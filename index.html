          <p>World music as a term for non-Western music was established in the 1980s. As a marketing term it stands for exoticism and Eurocentric thinking. Further, the leading digital platforms today use algorithms known for biases and filter bubbles to determine what should be consumed. Discovering new music becomes a passive experience where minorities stay under the radar.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project-text-paragraph">
          <p>For Not World Music, I scraped user ratings to determine outstanding albums from every country. This diverse collection can be explored freely on a Three.js based globe. The minimalist interface was connected to a streaming API for convenient but decelerated listening, allowing users to expand their musical horizon.</p>

          <p>The project received awards by the DDC for value-based design and by the ADC in the category »Creative use of code«.

          <p>To Be Continued is a theatrical installation about the perception of time in a digital age. Even though technology accelerates the world and seemingly makes it more efficient, it appears we still spend just as much time waiting. The performance thematizes the impact of such technology, while employing a chatbot as the main actor.</p>

        <div class="project-text-paragraph">
          <p>In the days leading up to the show, the bot collects data on our relationship with time. To allow it to express its findings during the encounter on location, I worked together with visual artist Noralie. We developed immersive animations inspired by the world of interfaces, apps and preloaders.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project-text-paragraph">
          <p>To Be Continued is a project by Studio Moniker, Nineties and Noralie.

          <p>Using over 1400 images from my childhood as input, a generative adversarial network was trained. The output is displayed on a helmet, which lends the wearer a face that retains some uncanny resemblance to younger versions of myself. Accelerometer data is used to map movements from the real environment to the latent space of the neural network. </p>

          <p>This results in dynamic morphing between portraits that range in style from realistic to generative cubism.

          <p>Creating images with AI is currently an isolated experience. Ecce.ai lets the ideas come together. Paintings like the Garden of Earthly Delights become a playground on which users can type everything imaginable and have it appear on the canvas. Bit by bit it is transformed, with contributions reacting or adding to each other, while the outcome after thousands of alterations is completely unpredictable.</p>

        <div class="project-text-paragraph">
          <p>The name is derived from Ecce Homo (“Behold the Human”), the name of a Christ painting that went viral after a good faith attempt at restoration. In a similar spirit Ecce.ai questions the authority of the old masters, allowing people to paint over the work and collectively create a contemporary masterpiece.
