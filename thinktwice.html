            <p>Nowadays, we have an unlimited supply of entertainment at our literal fingertips. This is great, but it might be a little too great. Users often fall into the habit of simply tapping their favorite app, when in hindsight they would have actually preferred to do something more productive.</p>    
            
            <p>That is why Marina Schwarz and I developed THINK TWICE—an interactive prototype of a modern app blocker. Instead of just being an easily bypassable pop-up, it strives to put emphasis on the intention behind the tap. That way, we can encourage a more conscious and deliberate app use.</p>
            
            <p>A long research phase and many user tests helped find an intuitive UI, which incorporates four modes. “Writing Prompt” asks you to write one or two sentences about why you tried to open the app. “To-Do List” takes you right to what is next up on your daily plan. “Meditation” asks you to halt for a minute to free your mind instead of cluttering it and “Mirror” opens the front facing-camera, thereby holding up a mirror to yourself.</p>
