          <p>DONNERWETTER (german for “gosh!” or “thunderstorm”) was an in­ter­ac­tive ex­hi­bi­tion on the sub­ject of weather vi­su­al­i­sa­tion. </p>
    
          <p>I show­cased a poster that vi­su­al­izes the vis­i­bil­ity in Augsburg on each day of the year, a pro­gram that uses wind data to blow your cur­sor around and the “Rain Maker”—a modified version of a tribal instrument that is traditionally used in ceremonies to invoke rain. In its modified state it uses live weather data and an Arduino microcontroller to suggest that the ritual was successful, displaying a city in which it is currently raining.</p>
            
          <p>Furthermore, I was part of the de­sign team and helped de­velop the even­t’s iden­tity. We used yellow lines on a black background to represent the “thunderstorm” aspect of the name and put double slashes between monospaced typography—reminiscent of the Java code, which was used in many of the exhibits.</p>
